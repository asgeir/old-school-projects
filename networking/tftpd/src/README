I'm more used to writing C++ than C so be prepared for some weirdness.

Only the binary transport mode is supported. Netascii seems like too much work.
The server will make a best effort to contain data requests to the specified
data directory but will be error prone (for example the current implementation
will allow reads from /path/to/data* if /path/to/data is the specified
directory)
